# FacialEmotionDetection

A framework for classifying images utilizing principal component analysis for compression and then a random forest model from the scikit-learn package. Created by Muyi Aghedo as a final project for Intro to Computer Vision (CPSC 480).

To use, download or pull repo. Attach a dataset of images for which every image is located in a folder corresponding to its intended classification. I utilized the dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/.
